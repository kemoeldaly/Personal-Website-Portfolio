                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am 29-year-old automotive enthusiast with a new passion for coding.
                     Originally from Suez, Egypt, I was lucky enough to live miles away from the 
                     Red Sea beaches until I was 14 years old. After moving and years of adapting,
                      I discovered many interests like cars, motorcycles, and recently, an interest 
                      in coding by coincidence through a YouTube video.
                    <p>I went to college for business but never saw the benefit of finishing it. 
                        and I do not regret not finishing my business degree because it would have
                         been a huge waste of money.</p>
                </p>
                <p>I am pursuing my passion by joining Coding Temple to expand my knowledge and skills. 
                    Although I studied business in college, I found my true calling in the world of cars
                     and motorcycles, combined with the power of coding, the sky is the limit.</p>
                <p>Aside from my technical pursuits, I enjoy taking long walks, spending time with freinds at the 
                    beach, working out, playing golf, and exploring everything related to oceans and lakes.</p>
